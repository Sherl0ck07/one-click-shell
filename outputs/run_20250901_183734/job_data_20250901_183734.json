This role is ideal for someone passionate about e-commerce/retail analytics and proficient in Python-based ML workflows.\nKey Responsibilities\nDemand Prediction: Develop and implement time-series forecasting models (e.g., using Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM) to predict rental demand by product (SKU), category, and city. Incorporate features like seasonality, holidays, promotions, and external factors (e.g., weather, economic indicators) to achieve high accuracy.\nChurn Prediction: Build classification models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forests) to predict customer churn based on subscription history, order patterns, and behavioral features. Use outputs to inform retention strategies and integrate with inventory models (e.g., estimating returns from churned users).\nInventory Management: Design optimization models (e.g., using PuLP or linear programming) to manage stock levels, reorder points, and refurbishment cycles, leveraging demand and churn forecasts to minimize stockouts and overstock costs.\nEnd-to-End ML Pipeline: Create data pipelines (ETL) for ingesting and preprocessing order data (e.g., from CSV sources with timestamps, SKUs, cities). Feature engineering: Generate 50-100+ features like lagged orders, customer tenure, day-of-week effects, and holiday flags.\nModel Deployment Monitoring: Deploy models as APIs (e.g., using FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes) for real-time predictions. Implement monitoring for model drift and retraining workflows. Conduct A/B testing and evaluate models using metrics like RMSE (for demand), AUC-ROC (for churn), and cost savings (for inventory).\nScalability Experimentation: Optimize models for large datasets (e.g., millions of orders) using cloud platforms (AWS/GCP). Experiment with advanced techniques like reinforcement learning for dynamic pricing tie-ins.\nRequired Qualifications\nEducation: Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field.\nExperience: 3-5+ years as an ML Engineer or similar role, with hands-on experience in retail/e-commerce analytics (e.g., demand forecasting, churn, inventory).\nTechnical Skills:\nProficiency in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and ML libraries (Prophet, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch).\nTime-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) and optimization tools (PuLP, SciPy).\nData pipelines (Airflow, Spark) and deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS SageMaker).\nSQL for data querying and cloud computing (AWS/GCP/Azure).\nSoft Skills: Strong problem-solving, ability to work in a small team, and experience with Agile/Scrum methodologies.\nDomain Knowledge: Familiarity with subscription/rental models (e.g., handling returns, refurbishments) in e-commerce.\nPreferred Qualifications\nExperience with reinforcement learning or advanced optimization for dynamic pricing.\nKnowledge of big data tools (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) for scaling models.\nPublications or projects in retail predictive analytics\nFamiliarity with RentoMojo-like platforms or the Indian e-commerce market.\nRole: Machine Learning Engineer\nIndustry Type: Internet\nDepartment: Data Science & Analytics\nEmployment Type: Full Time, Permanent\nRole Category: Data Science & Machine Learning\nEducation\nUG: Any Graduate\nPG: Any Postgraduate\nKey Skills\nComputer scienceCloud computingDemand forecastingMachine learningROCE-commerceForecastingMonitoringSQLPython\nReport this job",
